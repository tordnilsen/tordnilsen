### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Tord Nilsen, currently serving as a Senior Advisor at Nasjonalmuseet with a focus on digital innovation and artificial intelligence (AI).

My professional journey is a tapestry woven with strands of coding, design, and a profound understanding of human behavior, nurtured during my time as a personal assistant.

I am deeply passionate about merging technology with empathy to transform the way we experience cultural heritage. At Nasjonalmuseet, 
I lead initiatives that leverage AI to make our museum collections more accessible and engaging.

I'm particularly involved in developing open APIs and creating digital experiences that are centered around the user.

My role is not just about preserving our cultural legacy; it's about bringing it to life in the digital realm, ensuring that it resonates with and is accessible to everyone.
